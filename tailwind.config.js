// This is a Tailwind CSS configuration file that specifies the content sources
// for purging unused styles and extends the default theme. It includes all
// JavaScript and TypeScript files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories,
// as well as the `index.html` file in the root directory. The `plugins` array is
// currently empty, meaning no additional plugins are being used. The `extend`
// section allows for customizations to the default theme, but it is currently
// empty, meaning no customizations are applied at this time.
// This configuration is typically used in a React, Vue, or similar JavaScript
// framework project to style components using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
